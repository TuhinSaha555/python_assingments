# Assignment 3: Loops in Python

## üìú Objective
This assignment is designed to familiarize students with the control flow of various loops and their practical applications. Students will also learn the differences between `for` and `while` loops and use them to solve real-world problems.

## üìù Program List
1. **Overtime Pay Calculation**: Calculate the overtime pay of 10 employees at Rs. 12 per hour for every hour worked above 40.
2. **Factorial Calculation**: Find the factorial of a number entered through the keyboard.
3. **Power Calculation**: Compute one number raised to the power of another.
4. **ASCII Values**: Print all ASCII values and their equivalent characters using a `while` loop.
5. **Armstrong Numbers**: Print all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500.
6. **Matchstick Game**: Implement a matchstick game between the user and the computer, ensuring the computer always wins.
7. **Number Count**: Allow the user to enter numbers until they choose to stop and display the count of positive, negative, and zero values.
8. **Octal Conversion**: Find the octal equivalent of an entered number.
9. **Prime Numbers**: Print all prime numbers from 1 to 300 using nested loops.
10. **Range Calculation**: Find the range (difference between the smallest and largest numbers) of a set of numbers.
11. **Screen Fill with Smiley**: Fill the entire screen with a smiling face (ASCII value 1).
12. **Series Summation**: Add the first seven terms of the series:
   \[
   1/1! + 2/2! + 3/3! + \dots + n/n!
   \]
13. **Number Combinations**: Generate all combinations of 1, 2, and 3 using a `for` loop.
14. **Machine Investment**: Calculate the minimum life of a machine to make it a better investment compared to alternatives.
15. **Compound Interest**: Calculate the compounded amount for 10 sets of principal, rate, time, and frequency values using the formula:
   \[
   a = p \left(1 + \frac{r}{q}\right)^{nq}
   \]
