# Python Programming Assignment - Condition Control

This repository contains solutions to the **Condition Control** assignment from **Siliguri Institute of Technology (MCA-336)** for the **Python Programming (MCAN191)** course, given by **Dr. Tumpa Banerjee** and **Mrinal Das**. The objective of this assignment is to enhance understanding of `if-else` statements and decision control structures in Python through hands-on practice.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment includes various programs to practice decision-making in Python using conditional statements. Each program file contains comments to explain the code logic.
